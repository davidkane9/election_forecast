# 2018 Election Forecast

My colleague, [Ryan Enos](http://ryandenos.com/), has "pre-registered" [his forecast](https://twitter.com/RyanDEnos/status/1059405996320321536) for the 2018 congressional elections as follows: 

- Democrats easily retake the House. 
- I would be a little surprised, but not shocked, if Democrats retake the Senate.

Let me follow his lead and provide my own forecast.
