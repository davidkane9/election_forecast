# 2018 Election Forecast

My colleague, [Ryan Enos](http://ryandenos.com/), has "pre-registered" [his forecast](https://twitter.com/RyanDEnos/status/1059405996320321536) for the 2018 congressional elections as follows: 

- "Democrats easily retake the House." 
- "I would be a little surprised, but not shocked, if Democrats retake the Senate."

Let me follow his lead and provide my own forecast:

Both the statisticians and the betting markets are dramatically underestimating the power of the nationalist message which President Trump and Congressional Republicans are using in this election. Americans, for good or for ill, are concerned about illegal immigration, want a wall on the southern border and have no interest in allowing caravans from Central America into the country. By making the elections a referendum on these topics --- rather than simply an opportunity to express opposition to Republican economic policies --- Trump and the Republicans will succeed in bucking the historical regularity that the first midterm election is bad news for a new president.

Not only will Republicans keep control of the Senate, winning every seat they currently hold, but they will expand their majority by 3 to 5, thereby ensuring much smoother passage for future nominees, both to the Supreme Court and to other executive offices. McCaskill will lose in Missouri, Heitkamp in North Dakota and Donnelly in Indiana. The House, on the other hand, is much more favorable for Democrats. However, there will be no Blue Wave. Traditional Republican seats, like the 6th in Kentucky, which were thought to be competitive --- and on which the Democrats have spent tens of millions of dollars --- will mostly stay Republican. Many seats, like the 2nd in Maine, will be much more competitive this year than 2 or 4 years ago. But, in the end, Republican incumbents like [Bruce Poliquin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Poliquin) have done enough to paint their opponents as "soft" on illegal immigration and sanctuary cities to retain their seats. It may not be clear until a few days after the election, but Republicans will retain control of the House.
